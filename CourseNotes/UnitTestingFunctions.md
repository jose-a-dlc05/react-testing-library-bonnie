# Unit Testing Functions

- Functions separate from components
  - Used by several components
  - Complex logic
- Unit test if
  - Complex logic difficult to test via functional tests
  - Too many edge cases
- For complicated functions, unit tests help with:
  - covering all possible edge cases
  - determining what caused functional tests to fail
- Issue with functional tests:
  - high-level makes them resistant to refactors
  - high-level makes them difficult to diagnose
